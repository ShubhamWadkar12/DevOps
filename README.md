## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)**.  
Its main goal is to deliver software **faster, more reliably, and with better quality**.

## Why DevOps is Used
DevOps helps organizations automate processes, improve collaboration, and reduce errors in software development and deployment.

## Key Concepts in DevOps
- **Collaboration** – Developers and operations teams work together  
- **Automation** – Automates build, test, deployment, and infrastructure tasks  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Code is tested automatically after every change  
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** – Software is released frequently and safely  
- **Monitoring** – Systems and applications are continuously monitored

## DevOps Tools
- **Version Control** – Git, GitHub, GitLab  
- **CI/CD** – Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI  
- **Containers** – Docker  
- **Orchestration** – Kubernetes, OpenShift  
- **Cloud Platforms** – AWS, Azure, GCP  
- **Monitoring** – Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Benefits of DevOps
- Faster software delivery  
- Improved system reliability  
- Better collaboration between teams  
- Reduced deployment failures  
- Easy scalability and maintenance

## Conclusion
DevOps enables faster development, stable deployments, and continuous improvement.  
It is an essential approach for modern software development and IT operations.
